      <h2>Credits</h2>

      <p>The Plasma game engine and its tools were developed and open-sourced by <a href="https://cyan.com">Cyan, Inc</a>. This repository's code was forked from the initial release repository at <a href="http://openuru.org/">OpenUru.org</a>.</p>

      <p>The open-source Plasma engine is developed and maintained through contributions by volunteers. A full list of contributors can be found <a href="https://github.com/H-uru/Plasma/graphs/contributors">on GitHub</a>.</p>

      <p>This software is licensed under the GNU General Public Licence v3 (GPL v3) with exceptions for a list of non-free libraries used by the engine. No additional non-free library dependencies can be added to the project due to the difficulty in changing licensing exceptions.</p>
